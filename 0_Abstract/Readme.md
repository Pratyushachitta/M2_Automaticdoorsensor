# ABSTRACT : 



An Automatic Door Opener System is a simple project based on PIR Sensor and ATMEGA328 Microcontroller , which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object.



You might have seen Automatic Door Opener Systems at shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals etc. where, as soon as a person approaches the door (at about 2 or 3 feet), the door automatically slides open. And after some time (about 5 to 10 seconds), the door closes by sliding in the reverse direction.



Such Automatic Door Opener Systems are very useful as you do not need a person to standby the door and open it whenever a guest comes. Also, since the doors are opened and closed only when a person approaches the door, there is significantly less loss of air conditioning.


So, in order to understand the potential of this concept, we have implemented a simple Automatic Door Opener System using ATMEGA328 Microcontoller and PIR Sensor.
